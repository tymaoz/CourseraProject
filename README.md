CourseraProject
===============
This project project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Included are the following:

1) Instructions - explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected (listed here in README.md)  

2) Script for performing the analysis (called run_analysis.R)

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. (called CodeBook.md)
