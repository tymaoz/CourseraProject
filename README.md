CourseraProject
===============
This project project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Included are the following:

1) Instructions - explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected (listed here in README.md)  

2) Script for performing the analysis (called run_analysis.R)

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. (called CodeBook.md)


Description of how run_analysis.R works:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2)  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3)  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4)  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5)  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
